Portfolio Project 1: US Medical Insurance
This is a project which is used to showcase my skills in data analysis and visualization
I will be using a downloaded csv file extracted from kaggle on the US Medical Insurance
Will be making changes as I learn and possibly build a model to predict what insurance cost will be based off certain variables
